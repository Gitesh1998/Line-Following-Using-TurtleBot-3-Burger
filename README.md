### üèÜ Motivation

Autonomous mobile robots play a crucial role in modern robotics applications, from warehouse automation to smart transportation systems. The ability to **follow lines, navigate waypoints, and avoid dynamic obstacles** is fundamental for robots operating in structured and unstructured environments.

This project aims to **develop an efficient and robust TurtleBot 3 Burger system** that can:  
‚úÖ **Follow a predefined path** using real-time vision-based line detection.  
‚úÖ **Navigate to waypoints smoothly** while maintaining stability.  
‚úÖ **Detect and avoid obstacles dynamically** using sensor feedback.  
‚úÖ **Bridge the gap between simulation and hardware** for real-world deployment.

By leveraging **ROS2, OpenCV, and Gazebo Simulator**, this project not only enhances the understanding of robot perception and control but also provides a **practical foundation for real-world autonomous navigation**. The optimizations ensure smooth performance even with limited computational resources, making it an **ideal step toward scalable robotic applications**.


### üìå Prerequisites

#### üíª System Requirements

-   **Operating System:** Ubuntu 20.04 or later
-   **Processor:** x86_64 or ARM-based (Jetson Nano, Raspberry Pi, etc.)
-   **Memory:** Minimum 4GB RAM (8GB recommended)
-   **ROS Version:** ROS2 (Humble recommended)
-   **TurtleBot 3 Model:** Burger

üìå Please check the specific versions mentioned earlier before installation to avoid compatibility issues. üöÄ

### Usage:   


### üöÄ Usage & How to Run the Code

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Prerequisites**

Ensure that you have the required dependencies installed:

-   ROS2 Humble
-   OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`)
-   NumPy (`pip install numpy`)
-   A USB camera (or built-in camera) connected to the system
-   A TurtleBot 3 with lidar support

----------

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Set Up ROS2 Environment**

Before running the script, make sure ROS2 is sourced:

```bash
source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash
source ~/turtlebot3_ws/install/setup.bash  # If using a custom ROS2 workspace
export TURTLEBOT3_MODEL=burger

```

----------

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Run the TurtleBot 3 Simulation (Optional, if using Gazebo)**

If you want to test in simulation before running on real hardware, launch the Gazebo environment:

```bash
ros2 launch turtlebot3_gazebo turtlebot3_world.launch.py

```

Launch the **lidar node** for obstacle detection:

```bash
ros2 launch turtlebot3_bringup robot.launch.py

```

----------

#### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Run the Line Follower Code**

Navigate to the directory containing the script and execute:

```bash
python3 line_follower.py

```

If using a different camera index (e.g., external USB camera), modify this line in the code:

```python
self.cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0)  # Change 0 to 1 if using an external camera

```

----------

#### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Stopping the Robot**

-   If running in a terminal, press **Ctrl+C** to stop execution.
-   The robot will automatically stop moving when an obstacle is detected within **30 

### üìå **Expected Behavior**

-   The robot follows a **black line** using OpenCV.
-   It detects obstacles within **30 cm** using **lidar** and stops movement.
-   The bot will turn **left or right** if the line deviates from the center.
-   If the line is **lost**, the bot stops and waits.


### üîç Future Improvements

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Enhance Obstacle Avoidance** ‚Äì Implement a **more advanced obstacle detection** system using **depth cameras** or **sensor fusion** (lidar + camera) for better decision-making.

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Adaptive PID Tuning** ‚Äì Develop a **dynamic PID controller** that adjusts parameters in real-time based on speed, surface conditions, and external disturbances.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Multi-Line Detection & Intersection Handling** ‚Äì Extend the system to handle **multiple paths, intersections, and turn decisions** for more complex navigation tasks.

4Ô∏è‚É£ **Optimize Computational Efficiency** ‚Äì Use **hardware acceleration** (e.g., OpenCV with CUDA on Jetson Nano) to process images faster, improving real-time performance.

5Ô∏è‚É£ **ROS2 Navigation Stack Integration** ‚Äì Replace the custom waypoint system with the **ROS2 Navigation Stack** for more autonomous and optimized path planning.
